# API-Development_Express & NodeJS

This repository will serve as a codebase for the Free APIs developed using ExpressJS & NodeJS.
Now, users can create custom APIs with fake data and test them easily with different HTTP Verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). 
The data is retrieved from a local static file and new data POSTed to the server is saved in-memory.
